+ Forward Problem:
    - voltages has two dimensions:

        (1) 13, which were measured in once exciting.
        
        (2) 16, which is the number of excutions.

    - voltages is a function of: 
        
        (1) Target size

        (2) Target position (coordinate)

    - we can find their linear( or nonlinear) correlation property.
